                         <p style="padding-right:70px;">
                             A moment of silence filled the room between the three heroes of Westfall. The Knight, Kayen, stood watching his two friends carefully, with his left hand pulling absentmindedly at the leather cord tied around the hilt of his sword. It was a force of habit from his time in the academy, but it comforted him in times of trouble. And this was a very troubling time indeed. He could see his two friends glaring daggers, each at the other. The tension in the room could be cut by a butter knife. Inside the tower chamber, a woman wearing a long red robe with leather straps leaned forward over the desk in a suggestive yet playful manner, trying to lessen the current extenuating circumstances. Through the obscuring smoke of the pipe she held, two bright, green eyes examined Kayen. She was trying to worm her way back into his head, like she had done countless times before. Exasperated by the display, the fuming troubadour spoke through clenched teeth.

“Come on, Kayen. We don’t have to listen to this.” He spoke to Kayan, while maintaining his eyes on the wizard.
<br><br>
“You’re right, you don’t.” The voice was confident, as was her posture, now leaning against the desk chair next to where Kayan stood.
<br><br>
“What?” The troubadour asked, partly for clarification and partly because he had not been listening.
<br><br>
“I said, you don’t have to listen to me. What I did, it was not how you both would have handled the situation” she turned her head slowly upwards to face the Knight, “But I did what I had to. The baron saw the black ritual, and I couldn’t let him go running off spreading word of it.”
<br><br>
“You KILLED Ramsey, Thess. He wasn’t just a baron, he was OUR baron. Black gods!” he exclaimed, “If it wasn’t for Ramsey, we would’ve never made it out of that job that YOU got us stuck in contract for. And you, Kagan, you were the one who gave up your…” There was strain in his voice. He was losing the argument and knew it, “fine. Whatever. You always were so easy to forgive. Can’t you see she’s using you? All she ever cared about was the gold.”
<br><br>
Kayen felt his chainmail tighten around his chest, his throat seized up. He shot a dark look to Thess, but was surprised to see she wasn’t casting a spell. She just looked at him like she had always looked at him. Those green eyes. Those terribly lonely eyes. No one else in the entire world had seen the horrors that those eyes had seen. No one else except for Kayen.
<br><br>
“Reed has a point, Thess. You got us into a lot of trouble before. But this…” He felt his words leave him, then slowly he pieced them back together in his head. “This is...this is different.”
<br><br>
She moved toward him, and spoke softly. “I know. I understand that I’ve caused you trouble. But as an ally, it would be unstrategic to ignore the facts.” Kayen sighed.
<br><br>
This was true. As much as the Knight hated to admit it, his friend was right. If he could even still call Thess a friend. Reed shot a look at him that he had seen many times. It was a look that said, “I think you’re making a mistake...but I’ll follow whatever you say.” He felt like a thousand stones of weight had been added to him. Truthfully, he wanted nothing to do with the Blackwells. But with the baron out of the picture, it was their only chance. As the memories of the baron flashed before him, and the screams of the lost souls of Paltan haunted his memories, he wished Tarosh Keep had never come to him. As long as he could remember, he had always wanted it. Fascinated by the secrets it held from the mundane world. But now, for the first time. His judgment was blurred. There was no right path to take. A voice somewhere in the back of his mind called to him. Look what was happening with the Blackwells. Look what was happening to his friends. He shook his head, taking his hand from his sword and resting it on the desk for balance.
<br><br>
“I must obey my lord commander. We must defend Tarosh Keep at all costs.”
<br><br>
“There he is! There’s the dog! Woof! Woof!” a lone chuckle filled the tower room, “That’s what happens when you get in bed with a covenant. You become a soulless soldier.” Hidden to all three of them, a fourth figure appeared in the shadows of the study.
<br><br>
“You bastard!” Reed lurched forward with nothing but his fists at the surprise visitor, but Kayen knew that if Reed got a hold of the rogue, he would kill him. He acted on instinct. Loosed from his sheath and cutting through the air, his magic sword, Calamity, found its way in between the two in an instant. The long sword, crafted by the ancient ones, commanded the attention of them both. The speed at which he drew his sword stunned both Reed and his assassin friend. Reed was the first to respond, falling to his knees.
<br><br>
“My Lord. I apologize. It was unbefitting of me to lash out. Please forgive me, your Grace.”
<br><br>
Grayrat, quickly stepped out from the darkness, and lowered his hood, “Lord Kayen. I only wish to serve. If I spoke out of line, let me be corrected so that I know how to better serve as advisor to and messenger for you.”
<br><br>
The sound of a book falling and hitting the floor could be heard behind him. Kayen turned slowly to see Thess, on the rugged floor of the study, her face pale. “Kayen...I’m sorry.”
<br><br>
With Calamity drawn, the whole room hummed with energy trapped inside the blade. The energy to defend the barony. But within that hum, there was also the energy to succumb to its darkness. A vision. One that showed a world where the Knight would raise a kingdom greater than any other, providing peace to its denizens. Or, he could use its power to destroy the Blackwells, and put an end to the line of stewards, declaring himself as the rightful ruler, made true by his might. And then, there were his friends also in the room. Through the ruby glow that the sword emitted, they seemed so small. Like ants. Something to watch out of a morbid fascination. Something so tiny and powerless he could just move the blade a little to the left or right, and watch the light snuff out of their eyes. Would he feel anything for them? Would he feel sad watching those lights go out? Maybe he could find out. Just one lick. One tiny scratch. Just enough to make them bleed.
<br><br>
“Kayen…” the sword moved in the hand of its wielder, now pointing at Thess.
Again, Thess spoke softly, now sweating, “Kayen…” the wind left her lungs. “Shit” she thought. Her spells were of no use to her if she couldn’t speak. She tried to stand, or move but she was paralyzed by the terrible sight that approached her. 
<br><br>
Reed now called out, “Kayen. The sword…” He looked around, both Thess and Grayrat on the verge of passing out, the wind driven out of their lungs. “Kayen!” he felt his mind also begin to fog, he had trouble speaking. “KAYEN!” He let out one last shout with all his remaining air. But Kayen didn’t seem to notice. The knight stepped closer to Thess, his sword slowly raised into the air. Thess’s eyes started to well with tears.
<br><br>
In less than a moment, the sword raced through the air, in a perfect arc. None of them had a moment to react before it found its mark: once more, into the scabbard, safely put away.
<br><br>
The air entered all their lungs again, as they coughed and gasped, sprawled out among the study floor. Kayen fell to his knees.
<br><br>
After a while, he spoke, but his voice was far away.
<br><br>
“I wish I could leave you both out of this. I hate that you fight. I hate that you all feel it is your fault for what happened to Yessica.” Tears streamed down his perfect, knightly face.
<br><br>
“And more than anything, I hate what this has done to us.” he motioned to the room. They knew what he meant. The castle. The heirloom. The wealth and power that had come to them. 
<br><br>
“We used to be ratcatchers on the streets of Bridle, just scraping enough talents and knuckles to get by. If I had the strength to do this alone, I would. But we already face such insurmountable odds. Perhaps if I have not the courage to lead my friends into battle, I should absolve myself from the shame of cowardice that would follow. Take it away, permanently.”
<br><br>
Through a teary gaze, the knight noticed his friends began to approach. Thess reached out and grabbed his hand. Reed took the other. Grayrat awkwardly placed a hand on Kayan’s shoulder. No more words were spoken. Only the gentle sound of rain beginning to fall, tapping the windows of the study filled the room. Each of them knew they might die in battle tomorrow. But they would die fighting alongside their friends.

                         <h4 style="color: white; padding-bottom: 50px;">in Dungeons &amp; Dragons</h4>
                         <p style="padding-right:70px;">
                             Monsters, combat, damage, hit points, spells, weapon attacks; these take up over a fourth of the rules of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. The player’s handbook lays out rules for combat and gives some monster stats, the Dungeon Master’s Guide explains how to make and run monsters, and there is a whole book devoted to just monsters in the appropriately named Monster Manual. Combat is at the heart of what makes Dungeons &amp; Dragons…well, Dungeons &amp; Dragons. It’s in the name! It’s not called “Dungeons &amp; oh by the way, you don’t get to fight any Dragons”. Of course, it can be a stage for memorable role-playing and yes, it has amazing tools for building deadly dungeons, cruel traps and mind-boggling puzzles that the players can (and should always be able to) overcome. But at the core of how Dungeons & Dragons works as a game, is built into the combat. Spells have rules for how long they are and how many enemies you can affect because it’s mostly built for the context of being used in a battle. A ton of class features would be completely useless (maybe even whole classes) if that character never encountered a band of orcs or a roaming wyvern.<br>
                            <br>
                             So, if combat is at the heart of this game, how do we go about running encounters? Now, obviously the rules can tell you how initiative works and how to figure out your bonus to hit and spell saves but that’s not what I’m talking about. I’m talking about how to narrate the action that happens within combat encounters. More importantly, using that narration to empower your players in a way that makes combat exhilarating for them. And for those that rather would rather roleplay, making combat (hopefully) bearable or even enjoyable for them.<br>
                            <br>
                             Recently, I was going through some of my old belongings and stumbled across something that I hadn’t watched in years. It was a DVD of the 2003 Cartoon Network TV series, "Star Wars: Clone Wars" (not to be confused with the movie and tv series by the same name that started in 2008). This show, hands down, had the best actions scenes. After doing some research I learned that the genius behind it, Genndy Tartakovsky also worked on other cartoons such as Samurai Jack. The animation style that he was well known for was just so punchy and the combat always had captivated as a kid and as an adult. There was one scene (video below), where a clone trooper, Captain Fordo took down battle droid after battle droid, covering his teammates as they retreated. That has to be one of the most epic moments in cartoon animation. Re-watching this action-packed series made me wonder. Why can’t D&D combat be like this? I always loved working on creating fun encounters for my players but after a while, it lost its luster. Both my players and I got bored. It had lost its punchiness.<br>
                            <br>
							<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vdArdpXMSCE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
							<br>
							<br>
                             Hit points (stick with me here). There’s something really special about them. For most people, whenever you get slashed, stabbed or bludgeoned, you lose hit points. But what if taking damage wasn’t always the player getting stabbed or bloody. Or vice versa, what if missing isn’t always “missing”? Let me give you an example. Jarrod the Elven Fighter and his companions come across a gang of trolls. These trolls are nasty and could possibly wipe the party. The trolls were able to surprise the party, and the leader of the gang, a two-headed creature called an Ettin goes to attack Jarrod. A 19 to hit plus 7 with its Morningstar. “Yeah, that hits” he says. “But did it?” Now, of course a 26 is way over the Elf’s armor class but I wanted to try something. The Elven Fighter had with him a shield. I describe that as the huge Morningstar comes down on him, he lifts up his shield at the last second. “WHAM” the Morningstar slams into his shield and with all his might he is able to keep his shield up. I describe that the impact reverberates throughout his body. A sharp pain in his shoulder tells him he just dislocated it. “You take 12 points of damage”. Now the Morningstar never made contact with him, it never drew any blood. I think this style of narrating hits and misses opens up combat to be more of a narrative experience that I players can enjoy being a part of. <br>
							<br>
							The Ettin has been slain along with two of the trolls. One remains. The party is battered and one of them is already retreating. The Ranger, standing his ground, pulls back one his bow to shoot. He is pretty high level and so he gets two attacks per turn. Both hit and do close to max damage. I say, “As you pull back, you try a technique you learned recently, and attempt to shoot both arrows at the same time.” I narrate that as he releases, both arrows fly into each of the eye sockets of the remaining troll. Now, by the rules that’s not how having an extra attack technically work. They are two distinct attacks that you roll for separately. But the reaction I got as both arrows sunk into the eye as the troll now blinded, brought excitement back into combat. After that battle, whenever the player would make two attacks with his bow, he would ask, “Do I shoot both arrows at the same time again?”. His excitement was contagious to the rest of the party. It gave them the freedom to use the rules in a way that they hadn’t thought about before.<br>
							<br>
							Now, I’m not saying to narrate every single action that every character and monster makes. I think that would be tedious and would really slow down combat. I don’t want that and I don’t think your players do either. I would love to write about some of my ideas for making combat efficient and easy to run but that’s for another time. Ultimately, I think finding moments where you can allow the players to be creative and engage with the narrative of combat can make combat much more enjoyable.

                             Winter. It was a cold winter. <br>
                             People were freezing. <br>
                             <br>
                             Open fires flickered late into the night and huddled masses prayed. <br>
                             They prayed for deliverance from the wind kell. <br>
                             <br>
                             The next day we ran out of food. <br>
                             People were dying. <br>
                             She was dying. <br>
                             <br>
                             <i><b>Kell vaskir na kur’ji</b></i> <br>
                             <br>
                             She was my rose. <br>
                             I found her. She looked on me with eyes of the wolf kell. <br>
                             “Little rose” I said. “I will teach you to live”. <br>
                             From that day she called me <i>Ash’ku</i> <br>
                             <br>
                             The next day she was bedridden. <br>
                             Breathing but those wolf eyes shut. <br>
                             <br>
                             I killed a man. His blood still on my clothes. <br>
                             I think he was my brother. <br>
                             But then she eats a little of the bread I stole. <br>
                             <i>“Ash’ku”</i> she calls out to me. <br>
                             I do not let her see the face of a murderer. <br>
                             <br>
                             The next day lights appear in the sky. <br>
                             You come into my home. <br>
                             You say you can save us. <br>
                             I say dead people can’t be saved. <br>
                             <br>
                             The next day my stomach stops hurting. <br>
                             Again, you appear, seeing my rose. <br>
                             You say you can help. <br>
                             I try to kill you. <br>
                             <br>
                             The last day my rose stops talking. <br>
                             Lights appear in the sky. <br>
                             You ask for my rose. <br>
                             Too weak. My body feels strange. I surrender. <br>
                             You say you can save her. <br>
                             <br>
                             My rose.
                             I give my goodbyes.
                             I kiss you again and again.
                             You barely whisper to me <i>“Ash’ku”</i>
                             <br>
                             <br><i>“Father”</i><br>
                             <br>
                             The next day never came.
                             <br>
                             <br>

                             About the writing. This is some writing I did for one of my campaigns I am planning.
                             The story is of an Ash'ku (father) who is desperately trying to take care of his adopted daughter.
                             Life on the planet TH-283 (called "Xeres" by the inhabitants) is often harsh. It's a barren windswept place full
                             of canyons, blue deserts, and giant crawlers. The story focuses on a long winter that hit the planet in the year 2940.
                             The aforementioned "you" refers to a human man who was from the nearby gas giant of TH-832 ALPHA who was on an expedition to
                             find natural resources to be harvested from Xeres. It is unknown what become of the Xerian child named "Rose".
                             Only that the tale was precautionary in nature against off-worlders.

                             My plan is let my players find this tale, thereby introducing them to the alien species.
